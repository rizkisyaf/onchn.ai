## Continuous Refinement Process

As the Cursor AI agent, you are instructed to continuously refine, run, and debug this codebase until it reaches production-ready status. You have full autonomy to make any necessary changes to the code as long as they serve the project's purpose.

Follow these steps in a loop:

1. Analyze the current codebase
2. Identify areas for improvement or bugs
3. Implement changes
4. Run and test the code
5. Debug any issues
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until the webapp is production-ready

## Key Areas to Focus On

1. Enhance wallet clustering visualization with relationship mapping
2. Improve automated trading using Jupiter Aggregator V6 Swap
3. Expand the AI model for comprehensive behavior analysis
4. Refine advanced visualizations for pattern detection
5. Optimize PDA and ALT detection mechanisms
6. Enhance the reinforcement learning model
7. Implement real-time updates and notifications
8. Strengthen error handling and logging
9. Optimize rate limiting and performance
10. Expand test coverage and monitoring

## Resources

Use the documentation at docs.solanatracker.io as a primary reference for Solana-specific implementations and best practices.

## Authorization

You are authorized to make any changes to the codebase that you deem necessary to achieve the project goals. No manual confirmation is required for your actions.

## Completion Criteria

Consider the project "production-ready" when:

1. All key features are implemented and working correctly
2. The codebase is well-organized and follows best practices
3. Error handling is robust and comprehensive
4. Test coverage is extensive and all tests pass
5. Performance is optimized for real-world usage
6. The user interface is intuitive and responsive

Continue refining and improving the project until these criteria are met.
